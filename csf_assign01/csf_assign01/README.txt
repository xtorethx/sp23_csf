We met at Brody 1/26/23 and worked on the three functions for M1
together side by side. We contributed to the three functions equally.

We split up the functions equally and implemented them side by side. We met in person twice and on zoom once. We also went to office hours together and worked on functions while asking 
the TA for help and discussing with each other. We implemented tests for each of the functions we implemented.
